# HelloQUEST

## Notes on eventIDGenerator.py:
* Currently asks for the row number in the excel sheet and the abbreviation of the office code. Still need to look into the autmatic generation of the office code, and we'll be set.
* The last four digits are just randomly generated. Will deal with pulling the pin from existing data once I figure out a source.

## Getting Started
### Here is a list of commands to run in **Terminal** before running this code:
* xcode-select --install
* /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
* brew install python3
* pip install xlrd

### Now, clone the repository onto your computer. Type these commands into Terminal:
* git --version
* cd
* cd Desktop
* mkdir HelloFresh
* git clone https://github.com/laurayuzhengUMD/HelloQUEST.git

Check on your Desktop to see that the files have been added. 

## To run the script, type in Terminal:
* cd 
* cd Desktop
* cd HelloFresh
* python eventIDGenerator.py

## If updates are made and you would like to see them locally, type in Terminal:
* cd
* cd Desktop
* cd HelloFresh
* git pull
